Therefore, the patent claim can be infringed without infringing the rejected claim.","B":"File an amendment rewriting the claim in accordance with 37 CFR  1.121, and adding the corresponding atomic number immediately following the recitation of each metal ion","C":"File a terminal disclaimer under 37 CFR § 1.321.","D":"File a declaration of prior invention under 37 CFR § 1.131.","E":"File a reply traversing the rejection and arguing that 35 U.S.C. § 103(c), does not preclude patentability because \"the subject matter and the claimed invention, were, at the time the invention was made, owned by the same person or subject to an obligation of assignment to the same person.\"","answer":"A","analysis":"ANSWER: (A) is correct because there is compliance with 37 CFR § 1.111(b), which recites, \"The reply by the applicant .. . must distinctly and specifically point out the supposed errors in the examiner's action and must respond to every ground of objection and rejection in the prior Office action.\" The court in In re Vogel, 164 USPQ 619 (CCPA 1970), cited in MPEP § 804, Part II., A., stated, \"By 'same invention' we mean identical subject matter. Thus the invention defined by a claim reciting 'halogen' is not the same as that defined by a claim reciting 'chlorine,' because the former is broader than the latter.\" The court went on to state, \"A good test, and probably the only objective test, for 'same invention,' is whether one of the claims could be literally infringed without literally infringing the other. If it could be, the claims do not define identically the same invention.\" (B) is wrong because the amendment is not fully responsive to the examiner's rejection as required by MPEP § 714.02. Note that no argument is presented to \"\"distinctly and specifically point out the supposed errors in the examiner's action\" as required by 37 CFR § 1.111(b). Note further that the amendment does not change the scope of the claim. The Vogel case stated that \"a claim reciting a length of 'thirty-six inches' defines the same invention as a claim reciting a length of 'three feet' if all other limitations are identical.\" The same point is made in MPEP § 804, Part II., A. (C) is wrong because MPEP § 804.02 recites, \"A terminal disclaimer is not effective in overcoming a statutory double patenting rejection.\" Although helpful, unless a proper reply is filed (see Answer (A), a terminal disclaimer alone is insufficient. (D) is wrong because MPEP § 804.02 recites, \"The use of a 37 CFR 1.131 affidavit in overcoming a statutory double patenting rejection is inappropriate.\" Note that 37 CFR § 1.131 applies to both affidavits and declarations (E) is wrong because the argument addresses the basis of a rejection not made by the examiner, i.e., 35 U.S.C. § 103, and fails to address the double patenting basis of the rejection made by the examiner. Hence, the argument is not responsive to the examiner's rejection as required by MPEP § 714.02.","type":"single-choice"},{"index":2.0,"question":"Your client, Mr. Jones, asked you to prepare a patent application for his new pasta maker.

As explained in MPEP 706.02, \"for anticipation under 35 U.S.C. 102, the reference must teach every aspect of the ciaimed invention either explicitly or impliedly.\" The use of the phrase \"very similar\" can be understood to mean that the published article explicitly or impliedly taught every aspect of the claimed invention. Under this interpretation, (A) would be correct because the published article is prior art under 35 U.S.C. § 102(a) because, based upon the given facts, the invention \"was known . .- by others in this country, or . : . described in a printed publicarion in this .. . country, before the invention thereof by the applicant for patent.\" (B) would not be the correct answer under this interpretation based upon when the one year anniversary date occurs for the published article and when the patent application needs to be filed. 35 U.S.C.  21(b) states \"\"When the day, or the last day, for taking any action or paying any fee in the United States Patent and Trademark Office falls on Saturday, Sunday, or a Federal holiday within the District of Columbia, the action may be taken or the fee paid, on the next succeeding secular or business day.\" This section of the statute has been interpreted as modifying the one-year or twelve months' periods specified in various other parts of the statute and also for 35 U.S.C. § 102(b). See MPEP § 2133 and Ex parte Olah, 131 USPQ 41 (Bd. App. 1960). Therefore, the article would be a reference under 35 U.S.C. § 102(a) and not under s 102(b), since May 16, 1998, falls on a Saturday. (C) would also not be correct because 35 U.S.C. § 102(d) relates to (1) a patent, not a publication; (2) a reference of the applicant, not another; and (3) a foreign reference, not a U.S. reference. Likewise, the reference in (D) to 35 U.S.C. § 102(e) would not be corect because this section only applies to the filing date of a patent and the reference is a published article. The phrase, very similar\", could also be taken to mean that the published article did not teach every aspect of the claimed invention as required for anticipation under 35 U.S.C. § 102. Based on this interpretation, answers (A), (B), (C), and (D) would be rendered incorrect because they are all based on sections of 35 U.S.C. § 102.

After consultations with Smith and Apex management, you filed a terminal disclaimer complying with 37 CFR § 1.321(c) disclaiming that part of the term of the Smith application which would extend beyond the expiration date of the commonly assigned, copending 'XXX application. Upon the 'XXX application becoming abandoned, in favor of a Continued Prosecution Application (CPA), filed June 4, 1998, the examiner withdrew the rejection and substituted the following two rejections in the Smith application: (1) A rejection of all the claims under 35 U.S.C. § 102(e)\/103 as obvious over commonly-assigned U.S. Patent No. A,AAA,AAA to Able in view of U.S. Patent No. B,BBB,BBB to Baker, and (2) A \"provisional\" rejection of all the claims under 35 U.S.C. § 102(e)\/103 as obvious over of the CPA application in view U.S. Patent No. B,BBB,BBB to Baker.

It sells these goods to distributors, who resell them under a variety of brand names. In February of 1997, Smith, an employee of Trade Winds, conceived the idea, new at that time, of using a container made of clear plastic rather than the traditional tin spice package or an opaque plastic container. In due course, Smith came forward with a large, clear container in the basic shape of a tall box with an oval depression in each side that serves as a hand grip. The container also has a plastic screw-on lid which has a flip-up opening for spooning or shaking out the contents of the container. On March 11, 1997, Trade Winds filed a utility patent application in Great Britain which fully disclosed their new spice container and its unique design, and shortly thereafter, on April 10, 1997, the new container was displayed at a packaging trade show in Yorkshire, England. The container was such a success at the trade show that Trade Winds, on May 6, 1997, entered into a 3 month contract with Professor Yak, a renowned business consultant and Dean of the School of Economics at a university in the United States, to develop a long-range business plan for Trade Winds. In order to get feedback from people who might actually use the container, Professor Yak set up a study at his university in which he selected ten students who were dietetics majors at his university, and tasked them to test the functional features of the new container, the prior art tin container, and the prior art opaque plastic container. The study occurred between June 1, and August 1, 1997. A study guide outlined the methodology, wherein: (1) the students were to pick up the containers and describe how they felt (e.g., comfortable, awkward, easy to grip, balanced, etc.); (2) the students were asked which container they liked best, and why, and (3) the students were asked how the containers felt when shaking out their contents.

The PTO mailed to P an Office action. P, a sole practitioner, received the Office action. The application became abandoned for failure to respond within the three month shortened statutory period for reply specified in the Office action. A asked P every three months about the status of the application. P always advised A that the application was pending. P did not revive the application. Using letters, and billing A for work not performed in the application, P misled A into believing that the application was pending. Inventor A first learned of the abandoned status of the application in a telephone conversation with the primary examiner on June 12, 1998. On June 14, 1998, A engaged another practitioner, X, to assist in reviving and prosecuting the application. Since June 12, 1998, P has refused to respond to letters he received from A and X by certified mail, or to telephone calls from A and X, wherein A and X have requested P to provide a factual statement explaining what occurred.

P's non-diligence in failing to seek revival of the abandoned application cannot be charged to inventor A, in view of evidence demonstrating that P knowingly concealed abandonment from inventor A, and then covered up the abandonment by billing for work not performed, and giving misleading statements regarding the pendency of the application. (B) and (C) are not the most correct answers. In (B) and (C), X's statement is hearsay, as opposed to direct evidence, regarding A's acts, including A's diligence, and the communications A received from or had with P. Direct evidence of unavoidable delay must be presented. Krahn v. Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks, 15 USPQ2d 1823 (E.D. Va. 1990). In (B), the terminal disclaimer and disclaimer fee are not required since the application was filed after June 8, 1995. In (C), the effort to revive neither addresses nor demonstrates that unavoidable delay included any diligence by the applicant to know the status of the application. Applicant's diligent inquiry into the status of the application is required. Douglas yv. Manbeck, 21 USPQ2d 1697 (E.D. Pa. 1991). (D) is not the most correct answer. In addition to filing an unnecessary terminal disclaimer, the petition does not show that A made diligent inquiry about the status of the application, and otherwise omits significant amounts of direct evidence that the entire delay in filing the reply was unavoidable.

The abandonment of an application subject to a final Office action is not \"unavoidable\" within the meaning of 35 U.S.C. § 133 and 37 CFR § 1.137(a) where the applicant simply permits the maximum extendable statutory period for reply to a final Office action to expire while awaiting a notice of allowance or other action. The provisions of 37 CFR §s 1.116 and 1.135(b) are manifest that proceedings concerning an amendment after final rejection will not operate to avoid abandonment of the application in the absence of a timely and proper appeal. Unless the applicant is informed in writing prior to expiration of the period for reply to a final rejection that the application is allowed, it is the applicant's responsibility to timely file a notice of appeal and fee to avoid abandonment of the application. (C) is not correct. The filing of a continuing application without payment of the issue fee is not an acceptable proposed reply in an application abandoned for failure to pay the issue fee.

The contract contained no patent rights clause. While so employed, Smith had an opportunity to observe the research work being done and to chat with the Wesson research staff. Smith soon developed an interest in the research work being done, and realized that he could improve on the operation of the Wesson cellular phone. Soon afterwards, Smith designed a unique link scanning switching control mechanism which significantly improved the operation of the Wesson cellular phone. Wesson quickly recognized the importance of using Smith's invention in its business, and retained the services of Mr. I. M. Goody, a registered patent agent who is not an attorney.

Retirement, however, opened the door to renew his passion for tinkering, and soon he began to spend so much time at his pastime that he developed a reputation as an eccentric among his friends and neighbors. One day, while Jack was tinkering in his homemade shop and his wife, Jil, was entertaining relatives, Bruce, a visiting relative and a registered patent attorney, wandered into Jack's shop, and soon became entranced with one of the gadgets that Jack had invented. Bruce informed Jack that his invention appeared to be patentable and that he, Bruce, would be delighted to obtain patent protection for Jack for no more than the expenses involved, and that he, Bruce, could probably arrange to market the invention for little more than the effort involved in making a few phone calls. After very little persuasion, Jack retained Bruce to patent the invention, insisting, however, that he be permitted to review the final draft of the application, that he be consulted at every step of the prosecution, and that no prosecution decision be made without his concurrence. Bruce agreed, and thereupon prepared and filed a patent application naming Jack as sole inventor. Subsequently, Bruce succeeded in negotiating the sale of Jack's entire interest in the invention to the Star Financial Group, which in turn conveyed an exclusive license in the invention to the Omega Electrical Corporation. Both the assignment to Star and the license to Omega were properly executed and recorded in the PTO.

She informs you that the goop is formed from equal parts of chemicals W, X, Y and Z. She knows that chemical W comes from the soap she uses and that chemicals Y and Z are components of the conditioner she uses on her hair. Her soap uses the tradename \"Acme SmellNice\", and her shampoo and conditioner both use the tradename \"A-1 Silky.\" Chemicals W, Y and Z are all readily available on the commercial market. Chemical X is also a common, readily available chemical, but she cannot determine how it got in the shower drain. She suspects it is the result of a reaction between A-1 Silky shampoo and Acme SmellNice soap that occurs when the two are mixed in the presence of hot water. You prepare an application describing a prophetic example setting forth one way to make the goop from commercially available chemicals and a working example describing (as well as the inventor can) how the goop is formed in the bathroom drain. The working example describes mixing of A-1 Silky shampoo and Acme SmellNice soap in the presence of water having a temperature of at least 100°F to form chemical X.

A set of four horizontal tubular steel support members connects adjacent tubular steel legs to brace the legs. The barstool further includes a plastic back member connected to the topside of the plastic seat portion. The application states that wood could be used in place of tubular steel for the legs and horizontal support members. No alternative to plastic is mentioned in the application for use in the seat portion, but it is well known in the art that plastic and wood are interchangeable. As originally filed, Baker's application included the following Claim 1: A barstool comprising: (i) a rectangular seat portion having four vertical edges, an underside and a topside; (ii) means for supporting said seat portion such that said underside is substantially horizontal; and (ii) a back member connected to one of the vertical edges of said seat portion, said back member being substantially perpendicular to the topside of said seat portion. The Examiner rejects the claim under 35 U.S.C. § 102 as being anticipated by a 1997 publication by Baker showing a three-legged wooden barstool with a rectangular seat, a back and arms. The Examiner cites, but does not apply against Claim 1, a 1996 patent to Charlie that discloses a four-legged wooden barstool with a round wooden seat. The Charlie patent states that in barstools the use of plastic and\/or tubular steel is equivalent to the use of wood. Able responds to the rejection by amending his claim to require that the seat portion be formed of plastic, and by arguing that Baker does not disclose the recited \"supporting means\" because Baker utilizes only three legs, which is less stable than four legs. The examiner finds a 1980 Wilson patent that structurally equates three legged barstools to four-legged barstools. Which of the following is in accordance with proper PTO practices and procedures?","A":"The anticipation rejection is withdrawn only because Baker does not disclose a plastic seat portion. An obviousness rejection is then made based on Baker in view of Charlie since Charlie suggests replacing a wood seat with a plastic seat. Able's argument concerning the recited \"supporting means\" of Claim 1 does not provide a basis for overcoming the anticipation rejection.","B":"The anticipation rejection should be withdrawn because Baker does not disclose a plastic seat portion and because Baker does not disclose a four legged supporting means. An obviousness rejection is then made based on Baker in view of Charlie because Charlie suggests modifying Baker to utilize a plastic seat and four legs.","C":"The anticipation rejection is maintained because one of ordinary skill in the art would understand that a plastic seat could readily replace a wood seat. Furthermore, Able's argument that the \"supporting means\" of Claim 1 is not disclosed because Baker utilizes only three legs is unsupported by any limitation in the Claim.","D":"The anticipation rejection is withdrawn because Baker does not disclose a plastic seat. However, a rejection is made under 35 U.S.C. §112, paragraph 1 as being based upon an inadequate disclosure because the specification does not specify that the use of a plastic seat is critical to the invention.","E":"(B) and (D).","answer":"A","analysis":"35 U.S.C. §§ 102, and 103. Anticipation requires that each and every limitation in the claim be shown in a single reference, either expressly or impliedly. MPEP §§ 706.02, and 2131. Here, Claim 1 has been amended to require that the seat portion be formed of plastic (see fifth and sixth lines following the claim). Baker does not disclose or imply a plastic seat. However, Baker does disclose the recited \"supporting means\" because under 35 U.S.C. § 112, paragraph 6, that claim language covers under its literal scope the disclosed structure (four legs) and equivalent structures (three legs), and Able's argument is therefore unconvincing. MPEP § 2181. An obviousness rejection over Baker\/Charlie is appropriate because Charlie suggests replacing wooden seats with plastic seats. MPEP §§ 706.02, and 2143. (B) is not the most correct answer because the rationale that \"Baker does not disclose a four legged supporting means\" does not distinguish Baker from the claimed subject matter. Under 35 U.S.C. § 112, paragraph 6, the \"means for supporting\" in Claim 1 is equivalent to the supporting means disclosed in Baker inasmuch as the claimed means is not limited to four legs. The \"three legged\" supporting means in Baker is within the literal scope of the claim, and anticipation is not avoided on that basis. (C) is not the most correct answer because the issue of whether one of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that plastic could be substituted for wood goes to obviousness, not anticipation. Maintaining the anticipation rejection is improper because the claim has been amended to require that the seat portion be formed of plastic (see fifth and sixth lines following the claim), a limitation not disclosed by Baker. (D) is incorrect because there is an adequate written description of the plastic seat in the application, and applicants commonly (and properly) limit claims to a preferred embodiment during prosecution.

A ship propeller exhibiting excellent corrosion resistance, said ship propeller consisting essentially of a copper base alloy consisting of 2 to 10 percent tin, 0.1 to 0.9 percent zinc, and copper. The specification of the application teaches that the copper base alloy made with the addition of 2 to 10 percent aluminum increases the alloy's wear resistance without detracting from its corrosion resistance. However, adding aluminum to the surface of the propeller does not increase wear resistance. Which of the following claims, if any, if added by amendment would accord with proper PTO practice and procedure?","A":"7.

(A) is wrong because Claim 1 is directed to a ship propeller, whereas (A) recites a claim which purports to be dependent upon Claim 1 but involves a non sequitur, i.e., it is directed to a copper base alloy rather than a ship propeller. Therefore, the dependent claim is indefinite and violates 35 U.S.C. § 112, paragraph 2. (B) is wrong because Claim 1 is directed to a product, i.e., a ship propeller, whereas (B) recites a claim that purports to be dependent upon Claim 1, but involves a process step. Therefore, the claim is directed to more than one statutory class of invention and violates 35 U.S.C. § 112, paragraph 2. While a claim to a product may be permissible when defining the claimed product in terms of the process by which it is made or in terms of the process by which it is intended to be used (MPEP § 2173.05(p)), the situation presented here is different and not permissible. In this regard, the term \"consisting of\" in Claim 1 excludes any element, step, or ingredient not specified in the claim. Thus, as stated in MPEP § 2111.03, \"A claim which depends from a claim which 'consists of' the recited elements or steps cannot add an element or step.\" (B) recites a claim that also violates this caveat. (C) is wrong because it recites a dependent claim that attempts to add \"2 to 10 percent aluminum\" to the propeller of Claim 1. Since the specification teaches the addition of aluminum to the copper base alloy and not the propeller of Claim 1, the dependent claim introduces new matter. Thus, the claim may be subject to a rejection under the first paragraph of 35 U.S.C. § 112. MPEP § 608.04. It is not clear from the language of the claim that the addition of aluminum is to the alloy. (E) is wrong because it recites a dependent claim which is directed to a ship propeller according to Claim 1 including 2 to 10 percent of aluminum, which has been excluded by the term \"consisting of\" in Claim 1.

Accordingly, a timely application was made for a broadened reissue patent in which Charles sought claims without limitations relied upon by Roberts during original prosecution.

The Smith patent had a total of nine claims, with claim 1 being the only independent claim.

Accordingly, Smith properly filed a narrowing reissue application on September 30, 1999 along with a reissue oath stating that he believed the original patent to be wholly or partly invalid by reason of the patentee claiming more than he had the right to claim in the patent. As filed, the reissue application sought to narrow the first limitation of claim 1 to distinguish over the new prior art. Claims 2 through 9 were rewritten in independent form. On March 15, 2000, while preparing a reply to an Office action in the reissue application, Smith determined that he would like to add further claims to provide a desired range of patent protection. Thus, on March 17, 2000, Smith submitted an amendment that, inter alia, added new claims 10-19 to the reissue application, with claims 10 and 16 being presented in independent form. Each of claims 10-15 was narrower than original claim 1 in certain aspects, but broader than original claim 1 in other aspects. Each of claims 16-19 was narrower than claim 1 in all aspects, and was fully supported by the original reissue oath.

During the prosecution of the patent for the circuit board device, Rene's patent practitioner files the following claims 1 and 2: 1. An electronic device for automatically logging onto the Internet comprising: communication means for communicating on the Internet, said communication means further comprising circuit means for automatically entering a password, and storage means for automatically storing a password for logging onto the Internet. 2. The device of claim 1 wherein the communication means is a desktop computer. During the patent prosecution, the examiner cites as prior art a telephone with a memory, which automatically dials a telephone number. The examiner reasons that because the telephone can store the number in its memory, it would have been obvious to store a password in the memory as well. The examiner objects to claim 2 as being dependent upon a rejected claim. Being very eager to get patent protection and low on financial resources, Rene instructs the practitioner to combine claims one and two and allow the application to issue. One year and one day after issuance, Rene comes to you, a patent attorney, inquiring if her patent reads on a widely distributed, hand-held, pocket sized, portable device that is not a telephone and does not use a desktop computer to access the Internet automatically without a password, and if not, what corrective action is available.

Rene should be able to obtain broadened patent protection by reissue of the patent.","C":"Since Rene's original claim 1 was broadly written and since Rene narrowed her scope of patent protection by incorporating the limitations of the original claim 2 during the original prosecution, she is barred by the doctrine of recapture from enlarging her claims to the scope of the original claim 1.","D":"Although Rene narrowed her claims during the original prosecution, she can file a declaration stating that the narrowing of her claims was not because she believed the prior art precluded her from claiming more but due to financial concerns.

The doorknob is such that when carrying a large package, one may rest the package on the doorknob to stop the motion of the door. During a lunch break before completing the writing of the application for the patent on the automatic door stop, Chris' patent agent, Sam, visits a local Shack restaurant and notices a door stop which is actuated by stepping with one's foot on a mechanical lever located at the bottom of the door. Sam makes a mental note to ask a colleague as to whether he needs to disclose the doorstop at the Shack restaurant to the USPTO in conjunction with Chris' application in an information disclosure statement, but ultimately neglects to do so. Sam knows that the restaurant (and doorstop) was in existence at least one year prior to Sam's visit. In the first Office action, the only prior art uncovered by the examiner relates to stopping a door using a lever that engages a channel in the ceiling upon being pressed upward. The examiner rejects the claim asserting it would have been obvious to have either upward or downward actuating motion. In the reply to the first Office action Sam argues that the downward motion is essential because it affords the ability to actuate when one is carrying a package and that the prior art does not disclose a downwardly actuated doorstop. Following Sam's argument, the case issues. Claim 1 reads as follows: 1. A door stop for automatically stopping the pivoting action of a door by pressing downward, said door stop comprising: a) first means attached to a door for receiving a downward movement; b) second means for actuating a mechanism for engaging the floor surface in response to the downward movement of the first means, said first and second means being operatively connected. Which of the following is true?","A":"Since Sam knew of the doorstop at the restaurant and not Chris, there is no duty to disclose the Shack restaurant doorstop. An attorney need not disclose that which is within his personal knowledge in an information disclosure statement.","B":"Since Sam discovered the Shack restaurant device after he had started writing the application, the invention was fully disclosed to Sam. There is no need to disclose that which occurs after an inventor completes his application disclosure.","C":"Sam needs to disclose only patents or printed publications to the USPTO to satisfy the duty of disclosure. Since Sam was unaware of any patent or printed publication for the Shack restaurant doorstop, Sam does not need to file an information disclosure in this regard.","D":"Chris should file a request for reexamination seeking to have the Shack restaurant door stop considered.","E":"None of the above.","answer":"E","analysis":"ANSWER: (E) is the most correct answer.

Admissions by applicant constitute prior art. 37 C.F.R. § 1.104(a)(3). As explained in Tyler Refrigeration v. Kysor Industrial Corp., 777 F.2d 687, 227 USPQ 845 (Fed. Cir. 1985), the Fed. Circuit found that the district court decided on two separate and independent grounds that the Aokage patent was such prior art. One basis was Tyler's admission of the Aokage reference as prior art before the PTO during the prosecution of the '922 Subera patent. The court found that, in a wrap-up amendment, the Tyler attorney admitted in his discussion as to \"all the claims\" of the three Subera applications, that \"the most pertinent available prior art known to the Applicants and their representatives is the Aokage U.S. Patent 4,026,121 cited by the Examiner\" (emphasis added). In view of this explicit admission, the district court's decision was proper and was sufficiently based on clear and convincing evidence. The controlling case law in this court recognizes this principle. See Aktiebolaget Karlstads Mekaniska Werkstad v. ITC, 705 F.2d1565, 1574, 217 U.S.P.Q. (BNA) 865, 871 (Fed.

Thus, we must affirm the court's decision that the Aokage patent was prior art and as such binding on Tyler.

For purposes of these questions, it should be assumed that the statutes and regulations effective as of April 18, 2001 apply for all time periods covered by the questions. Joseph, a citizen and resident of the United States, invented a new brake for in-line skates and filed a nonprovisional utility patent application in the USPTO on February 8, 2001. The application as filed included a specification and claims in compliance with 35 USC § 112, three sheets of publication quality drawings, an abstract of the disclosure, and an information sheet listing the name and address of the inventor. The application was initially filed without an executed inventor's oath or declaration and without the required filing fee. The Office issued a \"Notice to File Missing Parts-Filing Date Granted\" on April 2, 2001. The Notice informed Joseph that he must submit an executed oath or declaration by the inventor, pay the required filing fee, and pay a surcharge for late submission of these items within two (2) months of the date of the Notice. Joseph received the Notice on April 9, 2001. Joseph brought the Notice with him when he left for an extended overseas business trip the next day, April 10, 2001. Unfortunately, the Notice was placed in luggage that was lost during the trip. Upon his return to the United States on July 26, 2001, Joseph obtained a copy of the Notice and, on August 2, 2001 filed a Reply in full compliance with the Notice. A Petition for a twomonth extension of time and all required fees accompanied the Reply. Joseph also requested waiver and a refund of fees associated with the Petition for extension of time on the basis that the delay was a result of his lost luggage and his extended trip overseas. In Joseph's view, even though he could have replied within the two-month period, it was unfair to penalize him for lost luggage. The request for waiver of fees was denied. A first substantive Office action on the merits of the application issued December 19, 2001 and set a three-month shortened statutory time for reply. All pending claims were rejected on the basis of prior art. Joseph filed a fully responsive Amendment on March 19, 2002, and a final Office action issued August 12, 2002 with a three-month shortened statutory period for reply. The final Office Action allowed certain claims and rejected other claims on substantially the same grounds set forth in the first Office action. Joseph filed a Notice of Appeal on September 19, 2002 and an Appeal Brief on March 18, 2003. A Petition for extension of time and proper authorization to charge a deposit account for any required fees accompanied the Appeal Brief. An Examiner's Answer issued on April 2, 2003, and Joseph filed a Reply Brief on April 15, 2003. The Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences reversed the Examiner's rejections on August 19, 2003. A Notice of Allowance and Issue Fee Due was mailed September 3, 2003.

See, 37 CFR §§ 1.702(e) and 1.703(e). Answer (A) is incorrect at least because the Patent Term Guarantee Act of 1999 applies to Joseph's application, which was filed after May 29, 2000. Answer (B) is incorrect because a failure to engage in reasonable efforts to conclude prosecution may reduce patent term extension, but is not a complete forfeiture of any extension. Answer (C) is incorrect because the three year period set forth in 37 CFR § 1.702(b) does not include time consumed by review by the Board of Appeals and Patent Interferences or any delay in processing of the application that was requested by the applicant. Answer (E) is incorrect because any reduction is based on an expected reply within three months of the Office action, regardless of the deadline set by the USPTO.

For purposes of these questions, it should be assumed that the statutes and regulations effective as of April 18, 2001 apply for all time periods covered by the questions. Joseph, a citizen and resident of the United States, invented a new brake for in-line skates and filed a nonprovisional utility patent application in the USPTO on February 8, 2001. The application as filed included a specification and claims in compliance with 35 USC § 112, three sheets of publication quality drawings, an abstract of the disclosure, and an information sheet listing the name and address of the inventor. The application was initially filed without an executed inventor's oath or declaration and without the required filing fee. The Office issued a \"Notice to File Missing Parts-Filing Date Granted\" on April 2, 2001. The Notice informed Joseph that he must submit an executed oath or declaration by the inventor, pay the required filing fee, and pay a surcharge for late submission of these items within two (2) months of the date of the Notice. Joseph received the Notice on April 9, 2001. Joseph brought the Notice with him when he left for an extended overseas business trip the next day, April 10, 2001. Unfortunately, the Notice was placed in luggage that was lost during the trip. Upon his return to the United States on July 26, 2001, Joseph obtained a copy of the Notice and, on August 2, 2001 filed a Reply in full compliance with the Notice. A Petition for a twomonth extension of time and all required fees accompanied the Reply. Joseph also requested waiver and a refund of fees associated with the Petition for extension of time on the basis that the delay was a result of his lost luggage and his extended trip overseas. In Joseph's view, even though he could have replied within the two-month period, it was unfair to penalize him for lost luggage. The request for waiver of fees was denied. A first substantive Office action on the merits of the application issued December 19, 2001 and set a three-month shortened statutory time for reply. All pending claims were rejected on the basis of prior art. Joseph filed a fully responsive Amendment on March 19, 2002, and a final Office action issued August 12, 2002 with a three-month shortened statutory period for reply. The final Office Action allowed certain claims and rejected other claims on substantially the same grounds set forth in the first Office action. Joseph filed a Notice of Appeal on September 19, 2002 and an Appeal Brief on March 18, 2003. A Petition for extension of time and proper authorization to charge a deposit account for any required fees accompanied the Appeal Brief. An Examiner's Answer issued on April 2, 2003, and Joseph filed a Reply Brief on April 15, 2003. The Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences reversed the Examiner's rejections on August 19, 2003. A Notice of Allowance and Issue Fee Due was mailed September 3, 2003. Joseph paid the Issue Fee on September 15, 2003 and the patent issued March 9, 2004. In addition to the facts set forth in connection with the previous question, Joseph's application had not and would not be the subject of an application filed in another country, or under a multilateral international agreement, that requires publication of applications eighteen months after filing. At the time he filed his application in the USPTO, Joseph submitted a nonpublication request and supporting materials that fully complied with all requirements for nonpublication of the application at 18 months. Which of the following statements is most correct?","A":"By requesting nonpublication of the application, Joseph \"opted out\" of the statutory framework for patent term extension and, therefore, no patent term extension is available.","B":"Submission of the nonpublication request does not affect any patent term extension that might be available to Joseph.","C":"Joseph may rescind his nonpublication request at any time.","D":"Statements (A) and (C) are true.","E":"Statements (B) and (C) are true.","answer":"E","analysis":"ANSWER: (E) is the most correct answer. Nonpublication of the application does not affect the patent term extension provisions of the Patent Term Guarantee Act of 1999. Thus, statement (B) is true.

UpNorth informed you it had been successfully using the invention commercially for the past fourteen months deep in the Canadian forests. The invention has not been used anywhere else by UpNorth, and the pulped timber from the UpNorth operations has not left Canada. At least one competitor, another Canadian company, lawfully observed the invention in operation during its first month of use with no restriction as to confidentiality or disclosure. UpNorth filed a Canadian patent application in December 1, 1999, prior to commercial use of the invention, but (in an effort to hold down expenses) chose not file a corresponding application in the United States.

While touring the facility, Adams saw a unique machine for squeezing the sap from the blue agave plant and preparing the sap for fermentation. The machine, which had been in operation for more than three years, was highly efficient and helped produce excellent tequila from a minimal number of agave plants. The owner of the production facility had sold a number of identical machines to other local tequila producers over the past two years. All of the machines remained local and none of the producers sold their tequila outside the local area. Aware that the blue agave plant was becoming increasingly rare, Adams immediately recognized the commercial possibilities of such an efficient machine. Adams returned to the facility under cover of night and took numerous photographs of the machine. Upon Adams' return to the United States, he worked from the photographs to make detailed technical drawings of the machine. He then promptly filed a patent application directed to the machine. Which of the following statements is correct?","A":"Adams may not obtain a patent on the machine because it was known by others in a NAFTA country before Mr. Adams made technical drawings of the machine.","B":"Adams may not obtain a patent on the machine because the machine had been sold more than a year before Adams' application filing date.","C":"Adams is entitled to a patent because all sales of the machine and the tequila produced by the machine were in Mexico; a goal of the patent system is public disclosure of technical advances; and the machine likely would not have been disclosed to the United States public without Adams.","D":"Adams may not obtain a patent on the machine because the machine was in public use more than a year before Adams' application filing date.","E":"Statements (A), (B), (C) and (D) are each incorrect.","answer":"E","analysis":"The correct response is (E).

Kat conceived, constructed and successfully tested a golfer's aid to help less-skilled players. Briefly, the aid includes a distance-finder that determines the precise distance from the golfer's ball to a target such as a fairway landing area or the hole. The aid obtains data concerning playing conditions (e.g., wind speed and direction, soil moisture, etc.) from a series of sensors distributed throughout a golf course.

A user interface allows manual input of situational data (e.g., ball in divot) and permits the user to override system settings and sensor data. The golfer's aid also includes computer memory that stores performance data calibrated to a specific golfer. In use, a digital processor determines a suggested play based on playing conditions and golfer skill level, and automatically displays information concerning the suggested play (e.g., recommended golf club and preferred line of flight for the ball).

Circuit found that the district court decided on two separate and independent grounds that the Aokage patent was such prior art. One basis was Tyler's admission of the Aokage reference as prior art before the PTO during the prosecution of the '922 Subera patent. The court found that, in a wrap-up amendment, the Tyler attorney admitted in his discussion as to \"all the claims\" of the three Subera applications, that \"the most pertinent available prior art known to the Applicants and their representatives is the Aokage U.S. Patent 4,026,121 cited by the Examiner\" (emphasis added). In view of this explicit admission, the district court's decision was proper and was sufficiently based on clear and convincing evidence. The controlling case law in this court recognizes this principle. See Aktiebolaget Karlstads Mekaniska Werkstad v. ITC, 705 F.2d1565, 1574, 217 U.S.P.Q. (BNA) 865, 871 (Fed.

Thus, we must affirm the court's decision that the Aokage patent was prior art and as such binding on Tyler.

Meeting the 30 day period for filing the information disclosure statement after allowance will prevent a reduction of the patent term adjustment already accumulated. Answer (A) is not the best answer. A request for continued examination will delay the issuance of the patent over permitting the original application to issue with the information disclosure statement filed, pursuant to answer (A), thereby causing loss of a portion of the 20 year term as the patent term is measured from the earliest priority date claimed, 35 U.S.C. § 154(a)(2).

Jones received an advisory action on September 27, 2001 stating that the proposed amendment to the first CPA would not be entered because it raises new issues that would require further consideration. Additionally, the proposed amendment did not meet the requirements for a complete reply under 37 CFR 1.111.

The CPA practice does not apply to applications that have a filing date on or after May 29, 2000. The Office will automatically treat the improper request for a CPA as a Request for Continued Examination under 37 C.F.R. § 1.114. However, the request for a CPA filed on December 28, 2001 does not satisfy the requirements of 37 C.F.R. § 1.114 to be a proper RCE because it lacks the filing fee required by 37 C.F.R. § 1.17, and the required submission under 37 C.F.R. § 1.114. Therefore, the improper CPA will be treated as an improper RCE and the time period set in the last Office action mailed on June 28, 2001will continue to run.

The examiner rejected Brick's claim only under 35 U.S.C. § 103 on the grounds that Reference X teaches a bouncing ball called \"Q,\" and that although \"Y\" and \"Q\" are not the same, it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill to make changes to the \"Q\" ball in order to obtain a ball just like Brick's \"Y\" ball.

He then dissolved an effective amount of Antiagra in salt water, poured the resulting solution into a plurality of twenty-gallon tubs, and heated the tubs to evaporate the water. The resulting blocks of salt, throughout which Antiagra was evenly disbursed, were distributed in overpopulated areas during deer mating season to serve as salt licks. Stags that used the salt lick show no interest in mating, thereby lowering the pregnancy rate among does and helping to control the deer population. Salt has retained you to conduct a prior art search and, if appropriate, prepare and file a patent application. The only relevant prior art located during the prior art search is a patent to Deere that discloses a salt lick on which a hormonal substance is sprayed. A doe that uses the salt lick ingests the hormonal substance which, in turn, suppresses ovulation and thereby reduces the pregnancy rate. You prepare and file a patent application that provides a fully enabling disclosure and includes four claims sets. Claims 1-5 are directed specifically to the non-hormonal substance (Antiagra), claims 6-9 are directed to a salt lick laced with a non-hormonal substance that, when ingested by a male deer, suppresses sexual function in the male deer, claims 9-14 are directed to the method of forming the salt lick, and claims 14-20 are directed to a method for controlling deer population by distributing salt licks that are treated with an effective amount of XYZ to reduce pregnancy rates. You also properly establish small entity status on behalf of Salt at the time the application is filed. Upon initial examination, the patent examiner issues a requirement for restriction on the basis that the application claims two or more independent and distinct inventions. Specifically, the examiner requires an election between (a) claims directed to the nonhormonal substance per se (claims 1-5); (b) claims directed to the salt lick and to the method of forming the salt lick (claims 6-14); and (3) claims directed to the method of controlling deer population by distributing salt licks that are treated with XYZ to reduce pregnancy rates (claims 15-20).

You prepare and file a patent application that provides a fully enabling disclosure and includes four claims sets. Claims 1-5 are directed specifically to the non-hormonal substance (Antiagra), claims 6-9 are directed to a salt lick laced with a non-hormonal substance that, when ingested by a male deer, suppresses sexual function in the male deer, claims 9-14 are directed to the method of forming the salt lick, and claims 14-20 are directed to a method for controlling deer population by distributing salt licks that are treated with an effective amount of XYZ to reduce pregnancy rates. You also properly establish small entity status on behalf of Salt at the time the application is filed.  Claim 6 of the application reads: \"A composition for reducing the pregnancy rate among wild deer population, said composition comprising salt and a non-hormonal substance that, when ingested by a male deer, is operable to suppress sexual function in the male deer.\" Claim 7 reads: \"The composition of claim 6, wherein said non-hormonal substance is XYZ.\" Claim 8 reads, \"The composition of claim 6, wherein said composition is formed in a block and wherein said non-hormonal substance is interspersed substantially evenly throughout said block.\" Each of these claims is fully supported by the specification. An Office action is mailed March 15, 2002. Claim 6 was rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 103 as being unpatentable over the Deere patent. Which of the following arguments, if presented in a timely reply to the March 15 Office action, is most likely to persuade the examiner to remove the § 103 rejection without presenting unpersuasive arguments?","A":"The invention of claim 6 provides an advantageous feature in that the substance that helps reduce the pregnancy rate is interspersed throughout the salt lick. Thus, the present invention is effective to reduce the pregnancy rate in deer so long as any portion of the salt lick is available to deer. In contrast, the Deere patent utilizes a substance that is sprayed on the outer surface of the salt lick and, therefore, is effective only so long as the outer portion of the salt lick is available.","B":"The invention of claim 6 provides an advantageous feature in that the substance that helps reduce the pregnancy rate is interspersed throughout the salt lick. Thus, the present invention is effective to reduce the pregnancy rate in deer so long as any portion of the salt lick is available to deer. In contrast, the Deere patent utilizes a substance that is sprayed on the outer surface of the salt lick and, therefore, is effective only so long as the outer portion of the salt lick is available.","C":"In contrast to the present invention, the Deere patent calls for the use of a hormonal substance that suppresses ovulation in female deer. Deere neither discloses nor suggests the use of a non-hormonal substance that, when ingested by a male deer, is operable to suppress sexual function in the male deer, as set forth in claim 6.","D":"The present invention relates to a technique for reducing deer overpopulation by causing male deer to ingest a novel substance (XYZ) that is operable to suppress sexual function in the male deer. The Deere patent neither discloses nor suggests such a technique and, therefore, claim 6 is neither anticipated nor rendered obvious by the Deere patent.","E":"Applicant was aware of the Deere patent prior to filing of the present application, and the claims were carefully drafted to distinguish the present invention over the Deere patent. Accordingly, reconsideration and withdrawal of the § 103 rejection of claim 6 is respectfully requested.","answer":"C","analysis":"Answers (A) and (B) are incorrect because they attempt to distinguish the claim on the basis of a feature that is not recited in claim 6, i.e., the substance is interspersed throughout the salt lick. Cf. claim 8. Answer D similarly relies on a feature that is not set forth in claim 6, i.e., presence of substance XYZ. With regard to Answer (E), a mere conclusory statement that the claim was carefully drafted to distinguish over the prior art is unlikely to be persuasive without reference to distinguishing features set forth in the claim.","type":"single-choice"},{"index":29.0,"question":"James Salt developed an environmentally friendly technique for controlling deer overpopulation. Briefly, Salt discovered a non-hormonal substance XYZ (\"Antiagra\") that efficiently suppresses sexual function in male deer with minimal side effects. Salt determined that the use of a non-hormonal substance eliminated adverse long-term health effects that may be experienced with hormonal substances. He then dissolved an effective amount of Antiagra in salt water, poured the resulting solution into a plurality of twenty-gallon tubs, and heated the tubs to evaporate the water. The resulting blocks of salt, throughout which Antiagra was evenly disbursed, were distributed in overpopulated areas during deer mating season to serve as salt licks. Stags that used the salt lick show no interest in mating, thereby lowering the pregnancy rate among does and helping to control the deer population. Salt has retained you to conduct a prior art search and, if appropriate, prepare and file a patent application. The only relevant prior art located during the prior art search is a patent to Deere that discloses a salt lick on which a hormonal substance is sprayed. A doe that uses the salt lick ingests the hormonal substance which, in turn, suppresses ovulation and thereby reduces the pregnancy rate. You prepare and file a patent application that provides a fully enabling disclosure and includes four claims sets.

You also properly establish small entity status on behalf of Salt at the time the application is filed.  Claim 15 of the application reads: \"A method for reducing pregnancy rate in wild deer population comprising the step of placing at least one salt lick containing an effective amount of XYZ in a location accessible to wild male deer so that XYZ is ingested by said male deer.\" The specification provides adequate disclosure as to what constitutes an \"effective amount\" of XYZ. In addition to the Deere patent, the examiner locates a prior art patent to John Doe that discloses the non-hormonal substance XYZ for use as a softening agent in skin cream. There is no disclosure or suggestion in the Doe patent of any other potential use for XYZ. Which of the following statements is most consistent with proper USPTO practice and procedure?","A":"The Examiner may properly reject claim 15 under 35 U.S.C. § 103 as being obvious over Deere in view of Doe because Deere teaches the method of distributing salt licks treated with a substance to reduce pregnancy rates and suppression of sexual activity in male deer is merely an inherent characteristic of a known substance XYZ.","B":"The examiner may not rely on the Doe patent in a 35 U.S.C. § 103 obviousness rejection because there is no evidence that Salt was aware of its teachings at the time the invention was made and therefore the invention could not have been obvious to Salt at that time.","C":"The examiner may rely on the Doe patent in making an obviousness rejection under 35 U.S.C. § 103 only if the Doe patent is in the field of Salt's endeavor or, if not in that field, then reasonably pertinent to the problem with which Salt was concerned.","D":"The examiner may properly reject claim 15 under the first paragraph of 35 U.S.C. § 112 because the specification is inadequate to enable a person skilled in the art to which it pertains to practice the invention.","E":"The examiner may properly reject claim 15 under the second paragraph of 35 U.S.C. § 112 because the recitation of \"an effective amount of XYZ\" renders the claim indefinite.","answer":"C","analysis":"MPEP § 2141.01(a).

A Reasonable Correlation Between the Evidence and the Asserted Utility is Sufficient,\" which states \"As a general matter, evidence of pharmacological or other biological activity of a compound will be relevant to an asserted therapeutic use if there is a reasonable correlation between the activity in question and the asserted utility. Cross v. Iizuka, 753 F.2d 1040, 224 USPQ 739 (Fed. Cir. 1985); In re Jolles, 628 F.2d 1322, 206 USPQ 885 (CCPA 1980); Nelson v. Bowler, 626 F.2d 853, 206 F.2d 881 (CCPA 1981). An applicant can establish this reasonable correlation by relying on statistically relevant data documenting the activity of a compound or composition, arguments or reasoning, documentary evidence (e.g., articles in scientific journals), or any combination thereof. The applicant does not have to prove that a correlation exists between a particular activity and an asserted therapeutic use of a compound as a matter of statistical certainty, nor does he or she have to provide actual evidence of success in treating humans where such utility is asserted. Instead, as the courts have repeatedly held, all that is required is a reasonable correlation between the activity and the asserted use.\" Since mice are routinely used to test anti-cancer drugs for their tumoricidal activity, it is reasonable to assume that the compound, spectaculysem, may be useful as a therapeutic agent.

The patentability of a product does not depend on its method of production. If the product in the product-by-process claim is the same as or obvious from a product of the prior art, the claim is unpatentable even though the prior product was made by a different process.' In re Thorpe, 777 F.2d 695, 698, 227 USPQ 964, 966 (Fed. Cir. 1985).\" The issue is whether the claimed mixture Y is the same as or obvious over the patented mixture Y.

In re Marosi, 710 F.2d 798, 802, 218 USPQ 289, 292 (Fed.

Accordingly, a comparison of the results obtained by conducting the process recited in the claim versus the process used by patent A and which shows that the claimed product exhibits an unexpectedly lower melting point would be a persuasive demonstration that, although the products would appear to be substantially identical, in fact, they are patentably different. Ex parte Gray, 10 USPQ2d 1922 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1989).

(B) is not the most correct answer. The patentability of a product-by-process claim is determined on the basis of product characteristics, not process steps. (C) is not the most correct answer.

In re Gottlieb, 328 F.2d 1016, 1019, 140 USPQ 665, 668 (CCPA 1964) ('Having found that the antibiotic is useful for some purpose, it becomes unnecessary to decide whether it is in fact useful for the other purposes 'indicated' in the specification as possibly useful.').\" The issue is whether Mr. Bloc has disclosed a specific utility for the claimed compound Y sufficient to satisfy the practical utility requirement of 35 U.S.C § 101. According to the set of facts, we know that compound Y is an intermediate in the chemical manufacture of synthetic Z. We are given two utilities for synthetic Z: 1) alleviating pain, a utility it shares with the natural form of Z; and, 2) curing cancer. The examiner focuses on the disclosure that synthetic Z is a cure for cancer. Even if one were to agree that synthetic Z's ability to cure cancer amounts to an incredible utility, a claim to the intermediate compound Y would not run afoul of the utility requirement of 35 U.S.C. § 101 where another substantial, credible and specific utility is alternatively demonstrated. Here, the specification discloses that synthetic Z, like the natural form of Z, alleviates pain. The alleviation of pain is another substantial, credible and specific utility and serves to give compound Y an alternative utility to that of being used to make a cancer-curing substance. An applicant need not show that all disclosed utilities are credible. An applicant need only show that one of the disclosed utilities is in fact credible. In re Gottlieb, supra. The establishment of a credible, substantial and specific utility renders the disclosure of an additional incredible utility superfluous, and therefore ultimately irrelevant. Accordingly, Mr. Bloc's best course of action is to make the argument that he has disclosed another substantial, credible, and specific utility, notwithstanding the disclosure of curing cancer. (A) is not the most correct answer. The advice could prevent him from getting a patent to which he may be entitled. (B) is not the most correct answer. A cure for cancer is ostensibly incredible. It is hardly a response to the examiner's rejection to ask for the chance to prove one can cure cancer. (D) is not the most correct answer. While it is true that the utility requirement is addressed to the claimed invention, which here is compound Y not synthetic Z, it is not enough to respond by repeating what the invention is but, rather, to show that the invention has indeed a substantial, credible, and specific utility. Whatever is claimed as the invention, it must comply with the utility requirement of 35 U.S.C. § 101. Here the examiner states that the claim does not comply, as evidenced by the incredible utility of the final product. It is Mr. Bloc's responsibility to then show that compound Y does comply with 35 U.S.C. § 101 by showing that its end product has a substantial, credible, and specific utility.

If the reference is shown to not disclose one of the acts, or its equivalents, then the reference fails to anticipate, which is the answer set forth in (C). Thus, (C) is the most complete answer. (A) is not the most complete answer because acts (1)-(4) are disclosed in the reference and the equivalent of act (5) has to be dealt with, i.e., the equivalent of continuing to walk may still be met by the reference unless the applicant shows through argument that the reference also fails to contain any equivalent for act (5).

A plastic insert for the bottom of a shopping cart comprising circular receptacles to receive wine bottles and to maintain them in an upright and stable position even while the shopping cart is moved about a store so that they do not fall and break. Patent A discloses a plastic insert for the bottom of a shopping cart comprising rectangular receptacles to receive cereal boxes and to maintain them in an upright and stable position even while the shopping cart is moved about a store in order to keep them organized in the cart. Patent A also discloses that the receptacles could be any circular diameter to receive complementary shaped bottles or jars such as to securely hold 2-liter soft drink bottles or mayonnaise jars. A primary examiner rejected the claim as being obvious under 35 USC 103 over Patent A reasoning that Patent A suggests to one of ordinary skill in the art an insert for a shopping cart with circular receptacles for the purpose of stably maintaining any bottle, including wine bottles, while pushing the cart about a store so that the cart remains organized. Assume the examiner has made a sufficient prima facie case of obviousness. Following receipt of the rejection, the practitioner filed a timely reply. The practitioner argued that Patent A does not render obvious the claimed subject matter because there is no suggestion of a plastic insert to keep a wine bottle from falling and breaking in a shopping cart.

The purpose for this in Patent A is to keep the cart organized, not as in the claim to prevent the object from falling and breaking. The difference in objectives does not defeat the case for obviousness because, as MPEP § 2144 states, the \"reason or motivation to modify the reference may often suggest what the inventor has done, but for a different purpose or to solve a different problem. It is not necessary that the prior art suggest the combination to achieve the same advantage or result discovered by applicant.

It suggests an insert with receptacles to hold bottles. That is enough to render the claimed subject matter prima facie obvious. The prima facie case is not rebutted by arguing that the purpose for the claimed insert is different form that specified for the insert described in Patent A. That is why answer (C) is wrong. To rebut the prima facie case, the practitioner must show a difference in structure instead. Answer (B) is wrong because the prima facie case is not rebutted by showing that Patent A does not teach wine bottles. This is not an anticipation rejection where identity of subject matter might be an issue. This is a question of obviousness. Therefore, it is sufficient to point out that Patent A is a generic teaching of shopping cart inserts that hold objects of any size and shape.

Following a proper restriction requirement, claims 1-10 were elected for prosecution. The primary examiner rejected claims 1-10. The practitioner filed a reply that only consisted of argument. The examiner was unpersuaded by the argument, and entered a final rejection of claims 1-10. In reply, the practitioner filed a continuing application containing claims 1-10 directed to a widget, and claims 11-20 directed to a method of using a widget. In the continuing application, the examiner enters a new written restriction requirement requiring a provisional election between claims 1-10 and claims 11-20. The practitioner believes the new restriction requirement is improper and would like the rejection in the parent application reviewed as well. The new restriction requirement has not been made final.

On the other hand, a composition claimed to have a theoretical content greater than 100% (i.e., 20-80% of iron, 20-80% of gallium, and 1-25% of copper) is not necessarily indefinite simply because the claims may be read in theory to include compositions that are impossible in fact to formulate.

The essential feature described in the specification and depicted in the drawings resided in a screen, pivotally affixed to opposing sides of the tray parallel to the major axis of the tray at points above the cat litter. In operation, as described in the specification, a cat would enter the device through one of the openings in the igloo-like cover stepping upon the screen, preferably wire mesh. The weight of the cat would cause the screen to pivot downward until it contacted the layer of cat litter. Following urination, the cat would egress from the device through a cover opening, the urine having passed through the wire mesh screen to be absorbed by the cat litter, and the cat having egressed without carrying any litter to be tracked into the surrounding area. During the day, ingress and egress from the opposing cover openings would result in the pivotally affixed wire mesh screen being subjected to a see-saw action, essential to break up and disintegrate dried fecal matter, thus permitting the matter to pass through the screen to the litter below.

Claim 1 reads as follows: 1. A ship propeller exhibiting excellent corrosion resistance, said ship propeller consisting essentially of a copper base alloy consisting of 2 to 10 percent tin, 0.1 to 0.9 percent zinc, and copper. The specification of the application teaches that the copper base alloy made with the addition of 2 to 10 percent aluminum increases the alloy's wear resistance without detracting from its corrosion resistance. However, adding aluminum to the surface of the propeller does not increase wear resistance.

(A) is wrong because Claim 1 is directed to a ship propeller, whereas (A) recites a claim which purports to be dependent upon Claim 1 but involves a non sequitur, i.e., it is directed to a copper base alloy rather than a ship propeller. Therefore, the dependent claim is indefinite and violates 35 U.S.C. § 112, paragraph 2. (B) is wrong because Claim 1 is directed to a product, i.e., a ship propeller, whereas (B) recites a claim which purports to be dependent upon Claim 1, but involves a process step. Therefore, the claim is directed to more than one statutory class of invention and violates 35 U.S.C.  112, paragraph 2. While a claim to a product may be permissible when defining the claimed product in terms of the process by which it is made or in terms of the process by which it is intended to be used (MPEP § 2173.05(p), the situation presented here is different and not permissible. In this regard, the term \"consisting of' in Claim 1 excludes any element, step, or ingredient not specified in the claim. Thus, as stated in MPEP § 2111.03, \"A claim which depends from a claim which 'consists of the recited elements or steps cannot add an element or step.\" (B) recites a claim which also violates this caveat. (C) is wrong because it recites a dependent claim which attempts to add \"2 to 10 percent aluminum \"\" to the propeller of Claim l. Since the specification teaches the addition of aluminum to the copper base alloy and not the propeller of Claim l, the dependent claim introduces new matter. Thus, the claim may be subject to a rejection under the first paragraph of 35 U.S.C. § 112. MPEP § 608.04. It is not clear from the language of the claim that the addition of aluminum is to the alloy. (D) is wrong because it recites a dependent claim which is directed to a ship propeller according to Claim 1 including 2 to 10 percent of aluminum, which has been excluded by the term \"consisting of\" in Claim 1.

Dr. Able's compounds are substituted dihydrobenzothiadiazines having an \"R\" group at position 3 of the benzothiadiazine nucleus wherein R is selected from the group consisting of phenyl, benzyl, and phenethyl. You prepare a patent application on Dr. Able's invention and file the application in the PTO on August 5, 1996. The sole original claim is as follows: A substituted dihydrobenzothiadiazine compound wherein the only variable is an \"R\" group at position 3 of the benzothiadiazine nucleus, said \"R\" group being selected from the group consisting of phenyl, benzyl, and phenethyl, and said compound exerting strong saluretic and diuretic effects and being useful in the treatment of heart conditions and hypertension. In the first Office action, the claim is rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 102(e) as unpatentable over the Baker patent, which issued June 25, 1998 on an application filed May 13, 1996. The Baker specification states that it is \"a continuation-in-part application of my application Serial No. 123,456, filed September 29, 1995 (now abandoned).\" The Baker patent relates to processes for preparing compounds having a generic formula which includes within its scope substituted dihydrobenzothiadiazine compounds, and a list of appropriate substituents disclosed by the Baker patent includes the compounds of Dr. Able's claim. One of the processes disclosed by Baker in the patent and in application '456 for preparing the compounds is identical to Dr. Able's process in all material respects. The '456 application discloses several closely related processes for preparing compounds having a generic formula identical to that disclosed in the issued patent. But the '456 application contained an even broader disclosure. Comparison of the generic disclosure and the nature of the substituents on the benzothiadiazine nucleus as disclosed in the Baker patent and the '456 application reveals that they both disclose the \"R\" group as including hydrogen, trifluoromethyl, benzyl, or phenethyl. In rejecting Dr. Able's claim, the examiner placed emphasis on Example 2 of the '456 application, particularly, the last paragraph, which stated that other reagents may be used in the preparation process employed in Example 2, and identified specific reagents, which if used would result in each of the compounds of Dr. Able's claim, i.e. compounds wherein the \"R\" group was phenyl, benzyl, or phenethyl.

Which one is most likely to overcome the rejection?","A":"phenyl","B":"benzyl","C":"phenethyl","D":"trifluoromethyl","E":"None of the above","answer":"A","analysis":"(A) is correct because the disclosure of \"phenyl\" as an \"R\" group limiting the variable of Dr. Able's claim occurs only in the abandoned patent application. i.e., the '456 application, referenced in the Baker patent. Since the 456 application became available as prior art only as of the date that the public gained access to the Baker patent, i.e., June 25, 1998, the '456 application is not available as a reference because the Baker patent was granted after Dr. Able's filing date.

When the claim is viewed without the steps of this mathematical algorithm, no other elements or steps are found.","answer":"D","analysis":"(D) is correct because, as explained in In re Donaldson, 29 USPQ2d 1845, 1850 (Fed.Cir. 1994), the PTO is not exempt from following the statutory mandate of 35 U.S.C. § 112, sixth paragraph, which reads as follows: An element in a claim for a combination may be expressed as a means or step for performing a specified function without the recital of structure, material, or acts in support thereof, and such claim shall be construed to cover the corresponding structure, material, or acts described in the specification and equivalents thereof. When construed in accordance with 35 U.S.C. § 112, sixth paragraph, the means language of the claim covers the corresponding structure described in the specification and equivalents thereof. Thus, the claim recites a machine of electronic circuitry elements, and is directed to statutory subject matter as defined in 35 U.S.C. § 101. In re Alappat, 31 USPQ2d 1545, 1555 (Fed.

In such case, the statutory mandate of 35 U.S.C. § 112, sixth paragraph, requires that the claim be construed to cover the described structure. Thus, the claim recites a machine and not a method or process. As stated in Alappat, page 1554, \"[jt was error for the Board majority to interpret each of the means clauses in claim 15 so broadly as to 'read on any and every means for performing the functions' recited . . . and then conclude that claim 15 is nothing more than a process claim wherein each means clause represents a step in that process.\" (B) is wrong because the means elements recited in the claim represent circuitry elements that perform mathematical calculations, which is essentially true of all digital electrical circuits.

In an Office action dated March 18, 1999, the examiner rejected the claims in Curly's application under 35 U.S.C. §§ 102(g)\/103 over Larry's patent in view of a patent granted to Moe on August 25, 1992. Larry's patent claims the coating apparatus with the spring released mechanism for operation at temperatures of at least 32° F. The patent to Moe discloses a piston activated mechanism (substantially similar to Curly's piston activated mechanism) in combination with a different coating apparatus. The Moe patent also discloses that the piston activated mechanism would only operate at temperatures below 32° F. The examiner properly found that substitution of the piston activated mechanism of Moe for the spring released mechanism in Larry's coating apparatus would have been obvious.

On August 31, 1998, Chris offers the automobile windshield wiper device for sale to the Ajax Motor Company, leaving a sample device for use in automobiles at the Ajax plant. Chris knew his device can be used with trucks only if the sensors are modified to accommodate the larger windshields, however no such modification has been made.

The doorknob is such that when carrying a large package, one may rest the package on the doorknob to stop the motion of the door. During a lunch break before completing the writing of the application for the patent on the automatic door stop, Chris' patent agent, Sam, visits a local Shack restaurant and notices a door stop which is actuated by stepping with one's foot on a mechanical lever located at the bottom of the door. Sam makes a mental note to ask a colleague as to whether he needs to disclose the doorstop at the Shack restaurant to the USPTO in conjunction with Chris' application in an information disclosure statement, but ultimately neglects to do so. Sam knows that the restaurant (and doorstop) was in existence at least one year prior to Sam's visit. In the first Office action, the only prior art uncovered by the examiner relates to stopping a door using a lever that engages a channel in the ceiling upon being pressed upward. The examiner rejects the claim asserting it would have been obvious to have either upward or downward actuating motion. In the reply to the first Office action Sam argues that the downward motion is essential because it affords the ability to actuate when one is carrying a package and that the prior art does not disclose a downwardly actuated doorstop. Following Sam's argument, the case issues. Claim 1 reads as follows: 1. A door stop for automatically stopping the pivoting action of a door by pressing downward, said door stop comprising: a) first means attached to a door for receiving a downward movement; b) second means for actuating a mechanism for engaging the floor surface in response to the downward movement of the first means, said first and second means being operatively connected.

There is no need to disclose that which occurs after an inventor completes his application disclosure.","C":"Sam needs to disclose only patents or printed publications to the USPTO to satisfy the duty of disclosure. Since Sam was unaware of any patent or printed publication for the Shack restaurant doorstop, Sam does not need to file an information disclosure in this regard.","D":"Chris should file a request for reexamination seeking to have the Shack restaurant door stop considered.","E":"None of the above.","answer":"E","analysis":"Since the claim reads on a downward moving actuator and only a upward moving actuator was cited during the prosecution, the Shack restaurant device was material to the patentability of the invention.

An electronic device comprising: circuitry; said circuitry operating to emit signals of a predetermined waveform; said signals being used to automatically change channels on a television set and automatically open the door of a garage. 12. A method for opening a garage door comprising using a television remote control device to emit signals, comprising the steps of: a) adapting a television remote control device to emit signals to open a garage door; b) pointing said television remote control device at said garage door; and c) actuating said television remote control to cause said garage door to open.

Kysor Industrial Corp., 777 F.2d 687, 227 USPQ 845 (Fed. Cir. 1985), the Fed. Circuit found that the district court decided on two separate and independent grounds that the Aokage patent was such prior art. One basis was Tyler's admission of the Aokage reference as prior art before the PTO during the prosecution of the '922 Subera patent. The court found that, in a wrap-up amendment, the Tyler attorney admitted in his discussion as to \"all the claims\" of the three Subera applications, that \"the most pertinent available prior art known to the Applicants and their representatives is the Aokage U.S. Patent 4,026,121 cited by the Examiner\" (emphasis added). In view of this explicit admission, the district court's decision was proper and was sufficiently based on clear and convincing evidence. The controlling case law in this court recognizes this principle. See Aktiebolaget Karlstads Mekaniska Werkstad v. ITC, 705 F.2d1565, 1574, 217 U.S.P.Q. (BNA) 865, 871 (Fed.

Thus, we must affirm the court's decision that the Aokage patent was prior art and as such binding on Tyler.

In June 2000, Michael moves to a new neighborhood and discovers while watching television that the remote control for his television not only changes the channels on his television set but also operates to open his neighbor's garage door. Michael, believing that people no longer need to have separate devices for operating their television and opening their garage doors, goes to a registered practitioner to seek patent protection on his new idea. The practitioner files a patent application in 2000. During the prosecution of the patent for the circuit board device, the practitioner files the following claims 11 and 12: \n 11. An electronic device comprising: circuitry; said circuitry operating to emit signals of a predetermined waveform; said signals being used to automatically change channels on a television set and automatically open the door of a garage. \n12. A method for opening a garage door comprising using a television remote control device to emit signals, comprising the steps of: \na) adapting a television remote control device to emit signals to open a garage door; \nb) pointing said television remote control device at said garage door; and \nc) actuating said television remote control to cause said garage door to open. \nWhich of the following is true?","A":"Since the television and remote control were sold in June 1998, claims 11 and 12 are barred by 35 U.S.C. § 102(b) since the device was on sale more than one year prior to the invention by Michael.","B":"Since the television remote control device was in public use more than one year prior to the filing date of the application, Michael may obtain the patent coverage for the method claim 12 but not the device of claim 11.","C":"Although the device was bought in June 1998, Michael did not use it to open a garage door until 2000.

Because of the proximity of the star outer surface to the inter core of the potato, the shape achieves optimal cooking of the potato when fried without resulting in an overly cooked outer surface. Molly, thinking that the invention is important, has two people, Sue and Tom, both sworn to secrecy, witness a drawing of the invention. Molly then locks the drawing in a safe deposit box where it remains for the next twelve years. Neither Molly, Sue, or Tom discloses the invention to anyone for the next twelve years. In December 2000, Troy invents a new potato cutter which produces potatoes having a star cross section, and the potatoes are then fried. The invention becomes an overnight success. Troy files a patent application on February 1, 2001. Molly, after seeing the success of Troy's invention in the marketplace, decides to file an application, also on February 1, 2001.

Answer (D) is incorrect because any reduction is based on an expected reply within three months of the Office action, regardless of the deadline set by the USPTO. Thus, the reduction in any patent term adjustment due to the missing parts notice would be approximately two (2) months.

The application was initially filed without an executed inventor's oath or declaration and without the required filing fee. The Office issued a \"Notice to File Missing Parts – Filing Date Granted\" on April 2, 2001. The Notice informed Thomas that he must submit an executed oath or declaration by the inventor, pay the required filing fee, and pay a surcharge for late submission of these items within two (2) months of the date of the Notice. Thomas received the Notice on April 9, 2001. Thomas was occupied with other matters and did not file a reply in full compliance with the Notice until September 3, 2001.

Ginny therefore declined representation of Debbie and gave her the names of a number of other qualified patent practitioners. Debbie, however, did not contact any of the individuals recommended by Ginny. Debbie visited Ginny again on December 1, 2000. At that time Ginny agreed to represent Debbie. A patent application was filed in the Patent Office on December 11, 2000. On May 15, 2000, Billie conceived an idea substantively identical to Debbie's. Billie immediately prepared a detailed technical description including drawings and visited a patent attorney. Billie filed a patent application on June 14, 2000. Later, on July 9, 2000, Billie built a prototype that implemented the concept and had fully and successfully tested it by August 11, 2000. With regard to a priority contest between Debbie and Billie, which of the following statements is most correct?","A":"Debbie will be awarded priority only if she can establish diligence for the entire time between May 14, 2000 and her actual reduction to practice in June 2000, and can establish that she did not suppress, abandon or conceal the invention.","B":"Debbie will be awarded priority only if she can establish diligence for the entire time between her conception in February 2000 and actual reduction to practice in June 2000, and can establish that she did not suppress, abandon or conceal the invention.","C":"Debbie will be awarded priority if she can establish diligence for the entire time between May 14, 2000 and her patent filing in December 2000, and can establish that she did not suppress, abandon or conceal the invention.","D":"To encourage prompt disclosure of inventions to the public, priority is always awarded to the first to file an application, in this case Billie.","E":"Billie must be awarded priority because his patent application established a constructive reduction to practice prior to Debbie's actual reduction to practice, even if Debbie was diligent in reducing her invention to practice.","answer":"A","analysis":"35 U.S.C. § 102(g); Mahurkar v.

Statement (B) is incorrect because Debbie need not establish diligence for the period from February 2000 until just before Billie's conception on May 15, 2000. Statement (C) is incorrect because, so long as there has not been an abandonment, suppression or concealment of the invention, Debbie need not show diligence between the actual reduction to practice and the patent filing.

The agreement states, in its entirety, that \"Mr. Block will transfer my new bouncing ball 'O' to Mrs. Cone for experimental uses only to perfect the ball's bounce. Mr. Block retains full control over the new bouncing ball 'O.'\" The primary examiner has no evidence that the ball was ever actually delivered to Cone. On June 2, 2001, Block receives an Office action dated June 4, 2001 from the primary examiner. The examiner has rejected Block's claim only under 35 U.S.C. § 102(b). The examiner explains in the Office action that \"the 1998 written agreement signed by Block and Cone proves that the new bouncing ball 'O' was in public use more than one year prior to the January 2, 2001 filing date of the application.\" Block believes he is entitled to a patent for his new bouncing ball \"O.\" How should Block respond to the rejection of his claim?","A":"Block should give up because the agreement is dated more than one year before the filing date of the application and that is enough to statutorily bar Block from getting a patent under 35 U.S.C. § 102(b).","B":"Block should respond by arguing that although the agreement was signed more than one year prior to the filing date of the application, it was never published and therefore cannot be relied upon as a \"printed publication\" under 35 U.S.C. § 102(b).","C":"Block should respond by presenting evidence by way of an oath or declaration of experimental use and arguing that any use of the ball by Cone would have been experimental use, not \"public\" use.","D":"Block should respond by arguing the agreement was signed by him, the same person who filed the application, which means that the invention was not \"known or used by others in this country.\"","E":"Block should respond by arguing that even though the agreement may suggest that the ball was in use more than one year prior to the filing of the application, it does not indicate that the ball was put on sale in this country.","answer":"C","analysis":"The issue is whether the invention was in \"public use\" more than one year prior to the filing of the application. The crux of the issue is whether the agreement, which is the only evidence the examiner relied upon, indicates that a \"public\" use has occurred. Issues arising under the public use bar of 35 U.S.C. § 102(b) are determined by considering the totality of the circumstances. In re Brigance, 792 F.2d 1103, 1107, 229 USPQ 988, 991 (Fed. Cir. 1986). The circumstances are that: 1) Even if Cone received the ball, she was limited to using it for experimental, not public, uses. And, finally, 2) even though Cone can conduct experiments with the ball, control of the ball remains with Block. In view of all these facts, the totality of the circumstances leads to the conclusion that a \"public use\" more than one year prior to the filing of the application did not occur. In view of this response, and assuming no other evidence of a public use is available, the rejection under 35 U.S.C. § 102(b) under these grounds should be withdrawn. (A) is wrong because it is not enough that a document is dated more than one year prior to the filing date of an application for it to constitute a statutory bar under 35 U.S.C.§ 102(b). The issue to be addressed by Block is whether the examiner appropriately rejected the claim over the \"public use\" clause of 35 U.S.C. § 102(b), not the \"printed publication\" clause. (B) is wrong because whether or not the agreement is a printed publication is irrelevant. The rejection is on the grounds of \"public use\", not \"printed publication\". (D) is wrong because the issue of whether an invention was \"known or used by others in this country\" is relevant to a rejection under 35 U.S.C. § 102(a), not § 102(b) which is at issue here. Furthermore, the fact that Cone also signed the agreement suggests \"others\" were associated with the use of the invention which would mean this response is incorrect even if the issue was the propriety of a rejection under 35 U.S.C. § 102(a). In that situation, the issue would not be whether it was used by others, since it plainly was, but rather whether the use was a \"public\" one. (E) is wrong because it assumes that the issue is whether the invention was \"on sale\". While the rejection was under 35 U.S.C. § 102(b), the \"public use\" clause, not the \"on sale\" clause is at issue.

Mr. Flash filed a divisional application containing claims for the method of making the candles and for the reflective housing on April 5, 1999. The examiner did not restrict the claims, but before the first action on the merits was mailed, Mr. Flash suffered business reversals and canceled the claims to the reflective housing to reduce the cost of obtaining his patent.

On April 1, 2001, Mr. Flash jumps into your office. He has just won a million dollars on some television game show you've never heard of, and he wants to \"revive his patents.\" He is also concerned about an article he tore out of the February 1986 issue of the trade publication Wicks and Sticks, that shows a drawing of a dissimilar candle that would nevertheless raise a question of patentability, with the caption \"It's just a dream: it can't be made we've tried a thousand times, don't bother.\" He also has a video tape first sold by a local hobbyist at his store in October 1999, showing a process of candle making that may be within the scope of his process claims. \"But it's such a stupid way to do things - it's expensive and it doesn't work very well-it doesn't even make a safety candle,\" Jack shouts, jumping on your desk. He is so excited he can barely get the words out. Annie volunteers to work with him to figure out what he can do.

The application includes a specification and a single claim to the invention, which reads as follows: 1. A new string consisting only of material Z that has the ability to stretch to beyond its initial unstretched length. On June 2, 2001, the practitioner received an Office action from the primary examiner rejecting the claim. The claim is solely rejected under 35 USC 102 in view of Patent A, which discloses a string consisting only of material Z. The Office action states, \"Patent A discloses a string consisting only of material Z. Patent A does not expressly teach the stretchability property of the string. Nevertheless, the recited stretchability is inherent in the string of patent A. Accordingly, patent A anticipates the claimed string.\" Mr. Bock believes he is entitled to a patent to his new string and authorizes the practitioner to reply to the Office action by arguing that his string stretches to ten times its initial unstretched length, something that patent A does not teach. Since this is not expressly taught in Patent A, the practitioner argues, Patent A cannot anticipate the claimed string.

In re Best, 562 F.2d 1252, 1254, 195 USPQ 430, 433 (CCPA 1977).\" The issue is whether the argument has persuasively rebutted the examiner's prima facie case of anticipation. The argument does not rebut the prima facie case. The claim is directed to a string consisting only of material Z. Patent A teaches each every element of that string; i.e., the string shape, material Z, and the string only consists of material Z. There is nothing different between the string of the claim and that of patent A. Under those circumstances, examiner correctly stipulated that the stretchability of the claimed string; i.e., the ability to stretch the string beyond its initial unstretched length, would be an inherent property of the disclosed string. Whether or not patent A teaches the stretchability of its string is not defeating. Even if Mr. Bock had discovered a new property for the string, it would still not render the claim patentable. In re Best, supra . Here all the product elements are the same and examiner made out a proper prima facie case of anticipation. The burden now shifts to the practitioner to show that the patent string is not the same. The reply, which seeks to establish a difference in properties without showing a concomitant difference in product material and shape is not persuasive as to error in the rejection. All the other answers are wrong. (A) is not the most correct answer. See MPEP § 2112. (B) is not the most correct answer. The anticipation rejection was correctly established and was not rebutted by the argument. (C) is not the most correct answer. See MPEP § 2112, discussing when a reference can anticipate based on an inherent, as opposed to an expressly or implicit, disclosure. (D) is not the most correct answer.

See, e.g.,…In re Gottlieb, 328 F.2d 1016, 1019, 140 USPQ 665, 668 (CCPA 1964) ('Having found that the antibiotic is useful for some purpose, it becomes unnecessary to decide whether it is in fact useful for the other purposes 'indicated' in the specification as possibly useful.').\" The issue is whether Mr. Bloc has disclosed a specific utility for the claimed compound Y sufficient to satisfy the practical utility requirement of 35 U.S.C § 101. According to the set of facts, we know that compound Y is an intermediate in the chemical manufacture of synthetic Z. We are given two utilities for synthetic Z: 1) alleviating pain, a utility it shares with the natural form of Z; and, 2) curing cancer. The examiner focuses on the disclosure that synthetic Z is a cure for cancer. Even if one were to agree that synthetic Z's ability to cure cancer amounts to an incredible utility, a claim to the intermediate compound Y would not run afoul of the utility requirement of 35 U.S.C. § 101 where another substantial, credible and specific utility is alternatively demonstrated. Here, the specification discloses that synthetic Z, like the natural form of Z, alleviates pain. The alleviation of pain is another substantial, credible and specific utility and serves to give compound Y an alternative utility to that of being used to make a cancer-curing substance. An applicant need not show that all disclosed utilities are credible. An applicant need only show that one of the disclosed utilities is in fact credible. In re Gottlieb, supra. The establishment of a credible, substantial and specific utility renders the disclosure of an additional incredible utility superfluous, and therefore ultimately irrelevant. Accordingly, Mr. Bloc's best course of action is to make the argument that he has disclosed another substantial, credible, and specific utility, notwithstanding the disclosure of curing cancer. (A) is not the most correct answer. The advice could prevent him from getting a patent to which he may be entitled. (B) is not the most correct answer. A cure for cancer is ostensibly incredible. It is hardly a response to the examiner's rejection to ask for the chance to prove one can cure cancer. (D) is not the most correct answer. While it is true that the utility requirement is addressed to the claimed invention, which here is compound Y not synthetic Z, it is not enough to respond by repeating what the invention is but, rather, to show that the invention has indeed a substantial, credible, and specific utility. Whatever is claimed as the invention, it must comply with the utility requirement of 35 U.S.C. § 101. Here the examiner states that the claim does not comply, as evidenced by the incredible utility of the final product. It is Mr. Bloc's responsibility to then show that compound Y does comply with 35 U.S.C. § 101. (E) is not the most correct answer. Noting that synthetic Z is modeled on natural Z does not go far enough in establishing a substantial, credible and specific utility for compound Y.

The patentability of a product does not depend on its method of production. If the product in the product-by-process claim is the same as or obvious from a product of the prior art, the claim is unpatentable even though the prior product was made by a different process.' In re Thorpe, 777 F.2d 695, 698, 227 USPQ 964, 966 (Fed. Cir. 1985).\" The issue is whether the claimed mixture Y is the same as or obvious over the patented mixture Y.

Accordingly, a comparison of the results obtained by conducting the process recited in the claim versus the process used by patent A and which shows that the claimed product exhibits an unexpectedly lower melting point would be a persuasive demonstration that, although the products would appear to be substantially identical, in fact, they are patentably different. Ex parte Gray, 10 USPQ2d 1922 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1989). Therefore, the best reply to the outstanding rejection would be to argue that the claimed product has an unexpectedly lower melting point and to support that argument with evidence showing that the result of the patent A process is a mixture with higher melting point as compared to the claimed product. (B) is incorrect. The patentability of a product-by-process claim is determined on the basis of product characteristics, not process steps. (C) is incorrect.

In reply, the co-inventors each submitted a declaration under 37 CFR 1.131 stating that they had actually reduced the invention to practice no later than March 13, 2002. However, the declarations failed to include two claimed features. Neither the particular antenna needed to enable the cell phone could receive transmissions from the local cellular transmitting tower, nor a detachable carrying strap was included in the declarations. As evidence of their prior reduction to practice, Smith and Jones submitted their co-authored journal article. The journal article contained a figure of the cell phone as described in the declarations. That is, the cell phone shown in the figure of the article lacked an antenna and a detachable strap. The article was received by the journal on March 13, 2002, and was published on April 30, 2002.

This is because a claimed invention may have a well-established utility, and an invention has a well-established utility if (i) a person of ordinary skill in the art would immediately appreciate why the invention is useful based on the characteristics of the invention and (ii) the utility is specific, substantial, and credible. In this case, the declarations specify a specific substantial and credible utility and explain why the declarants (i.e., persons of ordinary skill in the art) would immediately appreciate that the applicant's claimed composition would possess this utility.

Therefore, the disclosure of a general utility such as \"useful biological\" properties does not satisfy this requirement as fully explained at MPEP § 2107.01, under the heading \"I. Specific And Substantial Requirements.\" Response (C) also would not be persuasive since the rejection is based on the fact that the applicant's specification fails to identify any specific and substantial utility for the claimed composition or fails to disclose enough information about the invention to make its usefulness immediately apparent to those familiar with the technological field of the invention. This is explained at MPEP § 2107.01. The fact that the claimed composition has unambiguously proven to be useful for curing a form of cancer previously thought to be incurable does not negate these specification deficiencies. That is, notwithstanding this unambiguous proof, the fact remains that the applicant's specification fails to identify any specific and substantial utility for the composition. Moreover, it is clear that the specification would not make this specific usefulness immediately apparent to those familiar with the technological field of the composition since the cancer was previously thought to be incurable. Finally, response (E) also would not be persuasive.

MPEP § 2138 states \"35 U.S.C. 102(g) may form the basis for an ex parte rejection if: (1) the subject matter at issue has been actually reduced to practice by another before the applicant's invention; and (2) there has been no abandonment, suppression or concealment. See, e.g., Amgen, Inc. v. Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., 927 F.2d 1200, 1205, 18 USPQ2d 1016, 1020 (Fed. Cir. 1991); New Idea Farm Equipment Corp. v.

MPEP § 2138. (B) is incorrect, as abandonment, suppression, or concealment is not sufficient to establish a 35 U.S.C. § 102(g) rejection where the subject matter has been reduced to practice in that conception alone is not sufficient. See Kimberly-Clark v. Johnson & Johnson, 745 F.2d 1437, 1445, 223 USPQ 603, 607 (Fed. Cir. 1984). MPEP § 2138. (D) is incorrect because no prior patent application is required for a § 102(g) rejection. MPEP § 2138. Similarly, (E) is incorrect, because no prior patent application nor issued patent is required for a rejection under 35 U.S.C. § 102(g).","type":"single-choice"}]
